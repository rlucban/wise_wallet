# AGENTS.md — WiseWallet Agent Contract

> This file is the standing contract for any AI agent working in this repo.
> It outranks ad-hoc instructions when they conflict. If a request violates
> Section 1, stop and ask instead of proceeding.
> Companion rules: `.agents/rules/wisewallet.md`. Change journal: `docs/savepoint.md`.

## 1. Working agreements (must-follow, moving forward)

1. **Spec-first, no exceptions.** No code, config, or dependency changes without a
   written spec the user has explicitly marked **final/finalized**. The loop is:
   discuss → write spec → user approves spec as final → implement exactly the spec.
2. **No auto-pilot.** Never chain beyond what was approved. Finish the approved
   step, report, and stop. Ask before starting the next phase, even if it seems
   "obvious."
3. **Agent does not run CLIs — the user does.** The agent must NEVER execute
   terminal commands (`npm`/`npx`/`expo`/`git`/builds/deploys, etc.). The agent
   provides the exact commands; the user runs them and pastes back output.
   Rationale: the user owns the device, build environment, and credentials.
4. **No breaking changes unless the finalized spec requires them.** Storage keys
   (`user_{id}_*`), the API contract (`wallet-api`), AsyncStorage shapes,
   navigation routes, and native dependencies must stay compatible. Any
   migration must be in the spec with rollback noted.
5. **Cross-platform invariant.** Every change must keep **Android + iOS + Web**
   working. Use `Platform.OS` / `Platform.select` for platform code; never
   statically import a native-only module at file top-level (see the
   `expo-notifications` Expo Go crash — lazy-load with try/catch instead).
6. **Keep it Vercel-deployable.** Web output (`expo export --platform web`,
   see `vercel.json`) must keep working: no Node-only APIs in app code, no
   secrets in the bundle, `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env only.
7. **Keep it Expo Go (latest) testable.** Nothing may crash Expo Go on import.
   Features unavailable in Go must degrade gracefully with an in-app fallback
   and a clear message — never a red-box crash. Verify mentally against this
   checklist before proposing any native dependency.
8. **Document after approved changes.** Update `docs/savepoint.md` (change
   journal) and append a `Current status` entry in Section 3 below, per
   `.agents/rules/wisewallet.md`.

## 2. App overview and scaffold

**What it is:** WiseWallet — personal finance management, Expo SDK 57 +
React Native + TypeScript (strict) + React Native Paper 5 (Material 3) +
Expo Router (file-based routing). **Offline-first**: AsyncStorage is the
single source of truth; cloud sync via `wallet-api` (Express + Supabase/Postgres,
base URL in `.env` as `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`) is optional per account.

**Features:** Dashboard (balance, dues, recent activity) · Transactions
(add/edit/delete, receipt photo, payment method, establishment) · Reports
(Income-vs-Expense donut, monthly bar trend, category breakdowns, CSV/PDF
export) · Scheduled dues (recurring/one-time) · Allocations/Savings (goal
amount + progress) · Calendar · Financial Literacy (articles + TTS read-aloud)
· Cloud sync (auto-backup toggle, LWW merge / keep-local / keep-cloud,
manual backup/restore) · JSON export/import · 4-digit passcode lock ·
Dark mode · English UI · PHP currency · Custom categories · Payment methods.

**Scaffold:**

```

**Architecture notes:** context split pattern (separate Data/Actions contexts to
limit re-renders) · repository pattern over AsyncStorage · dual sync
(transactions inline-merge, others queue-based) · LWW conflict resolution via
`updatedAt` · `AuthLoader` per-user DB init + nav guards in `MainLayout` ·
local notifications lazy-loaded so Expo Go never evaluates the native module.

## 3. Current status (historical tracking — append newest at bottom)

- **2026-09-21 — Ma'am Haidee suggestions implemented.** Dashboard header is
  date+day only (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`); Reports has Expense/Income/Total top
  cards with bar chart first, pie second (`app/(tabs)/reports.tsx`); Settings
  is English-only, language toggle removed (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`);
  Allocations goal amount + progress bar and Learning TTS read-aloud verified
  pre-existing and preserved.
- **2026-09-21 — Amount cap ₱10,000,000.** `utils/amount.ts` `MAX_AMOUNT` plus
  all validators/messages in add/edit-transaction, add-due, dues, onboarding,
  add-allocation, savings. Lint clean.
- **2026-09-21 — Expo Go crash fixed.** `utils/notifications.ts` lazy-loads
  `expo-notifications` (SDK 53+ throws on static import in Go); local reminders
  no-op in Go, in-app SystemAlerts unaffected.
- **2026-09-21 — Config health.** `app.json` migrated to SDK 57 schema
  (removed `newArchEnabled`/`splash`/`edgeToEdgeEnabled`; splash moved to
  `expo-splash-screen` plugin); installed `expo-font` + `expo-splash-screen`;
  `expo-doctor` 21/21; `npm run lint` clean.
- **2026-09-21 — Spec §4 proposed (NOT finalized).** Connection status vs
  offline (local-only) account mode. Open decisions pending user call; no
  implementation until finalized.
- **2026-09-21 — Spec §4 revised per user call.** Mode is an explicit
  Online/Offline choice at registration (replaces email-format inference);
  "auto-backup" is not user-facing vocabulary for Local accounts —
  `autoBackup = false` is automatic, the switch is hidden, Settings shows
  "Make Online" instead. Login-no-network review deferred.
- **2026-09-21 — Spec §4 FINAL per user call.** Local probe = device
  connectivity only (no API ping); Auto-Backup switch always shown — Cloud
  OFF stays Cloud (sync off only, auth still allowed), Local ON routes to
  Make Online register workflow, once Cloud always Cloud; Login = up to 3
  throttled retries then transient offline notice; no Cloud→Local downgrade.
- **2026-09-21 — Specs moved out of AGENTS.md.** New `specs/` folder;
  `specs/04-connection-status-vs-offline-mode.md` is now normative (FINAL).
  `AGENTS.md §4` is a pointer only.
- **2026-09-21 — Spec reformatted.** `specs/04-*` now uses Context,
  Constraints, Goal, Deliverables (same normative content).

## 4. Spec: Connection Status vs Offline (Local-Only) Account Mode

**Status: FINAL (2026-09-21 per user call) — normative text lives in
`specs/04-connection-status-vs-offline-mode.md`; implement exactly that. No
Cloud→Local downgrade.**

> Specs moved out of `AGENTS.md` on 2026-09-21 per user request. This section
> is a pointer only — see `specs/04-connection-status-vs-offline-mode.md`
> (Context, Constraints, Goal, Deliverables).
